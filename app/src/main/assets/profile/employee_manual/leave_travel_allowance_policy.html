                                <li>The LTA is available to all employees once in every financial year.</li>
                                <li>Employees will be eligible to claim LTA only after confirmation and completion of
                                    1 year of service at IETS, whichever is later.</li>
                                <li>LTA paid to the employee is taxable, however, the employee may claim Income tax
                                    exemption by providing a declaration indicating:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Destination</li>
                                        <li>Mode of Travel</li>
                                        <li>Members of family traveled</li>
                                        <li>Total amount claimed</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>In order to claim the LTA, the employee must avail a minimum of 5 continuous Earned
                                    Leave excluding weekends or public holidays.</li>
                                <li>In order to avail the LTA, the employee must either submit the request for the same
                                    before traveling or within one week of resuming the duty. In case, the employee
                                    has taken a LTA advance, he/she must submit the requisite bills within one week
                                    of resuming the duty.</li>
                                <li>The employee may carry forward the unutilized LTA amount to the next year,upto a
                                    maximum period of four years. Any LTA in excess of four years entitlement will lapse.
                                    Four years in this case will include the unutilized LTA of previous year and the
                                    LTA for the current year.</li>
                                <li>In case the LTA entitlements are revised during the course of a year, employee who
                                    have availed the LTA before the revision will be entitled to the balance amount.</li>
                                <li>Leave Travel Allowance would be given once every financial year after confirmation
                                    and completion of one year of continuous service. Thus, if an employee joins on
                                    September 1, 2006, he would be eligible to claim LTA on or after September 1, 2007.
                                    However the quantum of LTA claimed would be as per the entitlement in the year April
                                    2007 - March 2008 in addition to pro rata entitlement for the period September 2006
                                    – March 2007 for that particular grade. He would again be eligible to claim LTA
                                    in the financial year beginning on April 1, 2008.</li>
                                <li>An employee will be responsible for the income-tax liability that the benefit may
                                    entail. As a ground rule, any LTA paid to an employee will be treated as taxable
                                    in his hands, and it is thus the responsibility of the employee to claim Income
                                    Tax exemption on the amount paid. This may be done by providing a declaration indicating
                                    destination, mode of travel, members of family traveled and total amount claimed.
                                    A brief note on the tax implication of LTA is attached:</li>

                                <li>LTA is not completely exempted from Income Tax unless the employee actually incurs
                                    expenses equivalent or exceeding the amount of LTA on travel for self and family.
                                    The exemption is applicable only for 2 journeys in a block of 4 calendar years starting
                                    from January 1, 1994 and only for destinations within the country.</li>
