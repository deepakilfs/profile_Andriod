                            <p>It is desirable and generally expected that issues / grievances are sorted out by the concerned employees through dialogue and mutual understanding. Further, it is expected that cohesiveness exists within the department and co-ordination between the different departments, as these are essential prerequisites to the success of any organisation. However, in the interest of good order and role clarity, employees are advised to adhere to the following procedure: </p>

                                <li>Intra- Department: Grievances / issues should be referred to and discussed with the supervisor / departmental head as the case may be and resolutions obtained with the reasoned judgment of the supervisor / departmental head.</li>
                                <li>Inter- Departmental: Employees should refer any grievances / issues to and discuss the same with their supervisor / departmental head who will interface with his counterpart in the other department for a resolution. However, each employee should first endeavor to resolve the issue directly with the concerned employee in the other department. Wherever necessary, details of resolutions / decisions arrived at could be recorded by a memorandum for further reference.</li>
                                <li>Harassment, including Sexual Harassment: The Company is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. If an Employee believes that he/she have been the victim of harassment, or know of another Employee who has, report it immediately. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Any Superior who becomes aware of possible harassment should promptly advise Management or the HR Department who will handle the matter in a timely and confidential manner. All such matter will be dealt as per the guidelines set by the Supreme Court in their Visakha Judgement.</li>
