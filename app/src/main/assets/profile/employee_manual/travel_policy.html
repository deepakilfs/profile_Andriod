                            <p>Employees who use their personal vehicle for inter-city official travel must take prior approval, failing which, the expenses incurred on fuel would not be reimbursed. Employees are also not allowed to use the Company-provided car for inter-city travel unless approved by the concerned Executive Director / Business Head in writing. With the singular exception of Executive Directors when travelling with Chairman and Managing Director, all other travel is to be strictly as per entitlement. A staff member entitled to travel by economy class cannot be upgraded to 'J' class, even if he is travelling with a senior level officer. However, the reverse may be applicable if the situation so requires.</p>

                            <p>The Company has been following a need based car hire policy for executive travelling to other cities. Based on feedback received from many of the locations, it is evident that in almost all the cities where we have our offices, there is facility of cool cabs / city taxies / metered taxies which work out to be economical without compromising on convenience. </p>
                            <p>It is, therefore, recommended that all executives travelling to different cities need to use one of the above suggested methods and should not hire the car for a day. Car hire would be permitted only in case the employees are required to visit a number of offices of different clients during the same day and are planning to return the same day, with the approval of Group/Dept Head.</p>
