                               Regardless of the outcome of the Complaint made in good faith, the Complainant and any person providing information or any witness, will be protected from any form of retaliation. While dealing with Complaints of sexual harassment, ICC shall ensure that the Complainant or the witness(es) are not victimized or discriminated against by the Respondent.

Disciplinary action will be taken by ICC against any such complaints which are found genuine.
